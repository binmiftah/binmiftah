## My coding Journey
I started out as an _ignorant critter_ in the world of programming until one day my dad decided to enrol me for a computer studies which he called it at that time. The company known popularly as MAJADTEK
I started with Ms Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Then I moved to graphic design using CorelDraw. After learning CorelDraw was when I was introduced to HTML and CSS of whuch I only learnt the basics then returned back to school as I was still a Senior secondary student at that time.

Long story cut short, I was back to coding after graduating high school. I began learning advanced CSS, Bootstrap, SQL(mySQL) and data cleaning.
Currently I'm working on completing Vue JS and perfecting my React JS.

## Here are some of my projects:

I hope I'm not hindered by anything. Make it easy for me Yaa Rabb🤲
